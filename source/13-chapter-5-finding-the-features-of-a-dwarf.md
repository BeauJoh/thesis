#Finding the Features of a Dwarf

This chapter focuses on generating the feature-space representation of a dwarf.
The methodology starts by reproducing the results shown in established literature -- using Microarchitectural hardware counters followed by principal component analysis, and compares these results to the newly generated feature-spaces using simulator instrumentation tools.

The results presented are used to evalute the sub-questions regarding:

* *Does Phase-Shifting occur within OpenCL kernels?*
* *Are the principal components used when performing microarchitecture independent analysis transferable to architecture independent analysis.*
* *How is the feature space generated from instrumentation tools -- such as `oclgrind` -- comparable to those generated from hardware monitoring processes -- namely PIN. Is it more accurate or applicable to the OpenCL platform.*
* *In what ways does incorrectly setting tuning arguments and compiler flags effect the features-space of an OpenCL kernel?*
