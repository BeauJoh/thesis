#Application-Accelerator Prediction

This Chapter uses the performance results presented in Chapter 4 and the feature-spaces presented in Chapter 5 to develop a model.
The feature-space first undergoes a reduction to simplify the space from the application domain to one focused on the superset of applications -- dwarfs.
This model is then used to predict an optimal accelerator type for new OpenCL kernels, ones unused for the model development.
The evaluation of this model is presented and the corresponding feasibility addresses the primary question raised by this thesis, namely: *Can the structure of OpenCL kernels be used determine the type of accelerator on which it should be run?*
