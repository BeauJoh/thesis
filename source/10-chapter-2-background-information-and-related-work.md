#Background Information and Related Work

The chapter presents background information, terminology and the related work drawn upon in the rest of this thesis.
It provides a background for readers who might not be familiar with workload characterisation of programs, the associated performance metrics or composition of current HPC systems and how their performance is evaluated.
It begins with an introduction of the Dwarf Taxonomy.
Next, the definition of accelerators and a brief survey regarding their use in supercomputing and presents the hardware agnostic programming framework -- OpenCL.
Finally, a discussion of benchmark suites which incorporate the dwarf taxonomy is presented.

## The Dwarf Taxonomy

Phil Colella [@colelladefining] identified seven motifs of numerical methods which he thought would be important for the next decade.
Based on this style of analysis, The Berkeley Dwarf Taxonomy was conceived.
Initially performed by the Asanovic et. al. [@asanovic2006landscape], the Dwarf Taxonomy outlines that many applications in scientific computing share parallel patterns of communication and computation.
Applications with similar patterns are defined as being represented by a single Dwarf.
Dwarfs are removed from specific implementations and optimisations.
There are 13 Dwarfs in total.

During the Asanovic et. al. [@asanovic2006landscape] paper, a summary of the diverse set of application benchmarks is presented and whilst it is believed that more Dwarfs may be added to this list in the future all currently encountered scientific codes can be classified as belonging to one or more of these Dwarfs.
For each of the 13 Dwarfs the authors indicate the performance limit -- in other words, whether the dwarf is compute bound, memory latency limited or memory bandwidth limited.
The Dwarfs and their limiting factors are presented in Table \ref{tbl:dwarf-taxonomy}.
Note, the **?** symbol indicates the unknown performance limit at the time of publication.

Implementations of applications that are represented by the Dwarf Taxonomy are discussed in the benchmark evaluations presented in Section \ref{sec:chapter2-benchmark-suites}.
However, having familiarity with the division of applications and tasks commonly performed on supercomputers positions the use of accelerators for specific Dwarfs.


## Accelerator Architectures in HPC {#sec:chapter2-accelerator-architectures}

Accelerators, in this setting, refer to any form of specialised hardware which may accelerate a given application code.
Fortunately, from The Dwarf Taxonomy previously presented it is envisaged that all applications represented by a dwarf are are better suited to specific types of accelerator.
Accelerators commonly include CPU, GPU, FPGA, DSP, ASIC and MIC devices.

Central Processing Units (CPU) have additional circuitry for branch control logic, and generally operate at a high frequency, ensuring this architecture is highly suited to sequential tasks or workloads with many divergent logical comparisons -- corresponding to the finite-state machine, combinational logic, dynamic programming and backtrack branch and bound dwarfs of the Berkeley Dwarf Taxonomy.

Graphics Processing Units (GPU) as the name would suggest, accelerate manipulating computer graphics and image processing and is achieved by having circuit designs to apply the same alterations to many portions of memory at once.
This highly parallel structure makes them suitable for applications which involve processing large blocks of data.

Many Integrated Core (MIC) architectures are an Intel Corporation specific accelerator.
It is similar to a GPU, by having many low frequency in-order cores sharing the same bus however the primary difference being each core is based on conventional CPU x86 architectures.

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) are accelerators which allows the physical hardware to be reconfigured for any specific task.
They are comprised of a high number of logic-gates organised into logic-blocks with fast I/O rates and bi-directional communication between them.
Despite the diversity of these accelerators, indeed they seem to be suited to the characteristics of many dwarfs, the compilation or configuring the hardware for an application takes many orders of magnitude longer than any of the other examined accelerator architectures.

Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is an integrated circuit designed for a specific task.
In this regard, they are akin to FPGAs without the ability to be reconfigured.
They have been actively used to accelerate the hashing workloads from the Combinational Logic dwarf for bitcoin mining tasks.

Digital Signal Processors (DSP) have their origins in audio processing -- specifically in telephone exchanges and more recently in mobile phones -- where streams of data are constantly arriving and an identical task is needed to be applied.
Audio compression is one example.
They operate on a separate clock and have circular memory buffers which allow a host device -- using shared memory -- to provide and remove data for processing without ever interrupting the DSP.

Given the variation between accelerators, they are becoming increasingly used in High-performance computing (HPC) -- where heterogeneity is increased by using a greater number of accelerators within a node.
A major motivation for this is to reduce energy use; indeed, without significant improvements in energy efficiency, the cost of exascale computing will be prohibitive.
From June 2016 to June 2017, the average energy efficiency of the top 10 of the Green500 supercomputers rose by 2.3x, from 4.8 to 11.1 gigaflops per watt [@feldman_2017].
For many systems, this was made possible by highly energy-efficient Nvidia Tesla P100 GPUs.
In addition to GPUs, future HPC architectures are also likely to include nodes with FPGA, DSP, ASIC and MIC components.
A single node may be heterogeneous, containing multiple different computing devices; moreover, an HPC system may offer nodes of different types.
For example, the Cori system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory comprises 2,388 Cray XC40 nodes with Intel Haswell CPUs, and 9,688 Intel Xeon Phi nodes [@declerck2016cori].
The Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is based on the IBM Power9 CPU, which includes both NVLINK [@morgan_2016], a high bandwidth interconnect between Nvidia GPUs; and CAPI, an interconnect to support FPGAs and other accelerators [@morgan_2017].
Promising next-generation architectures include Fujitsu's Post-K [@morgan_2016_postk], and Cray's CS-400, which forms the platform for the Isambard supercomputer [@feldman_2017_isambard].
Both architectures use ARM cores alongside other conventional accelerators, with several Intel Xeon Phi and Nvidia P100 GPUs per node.


## The Open Compute Language Setting

OpenCL (Open Compute Language) is a standard that allows computationally intensive codes to be written once and run efficiently on any compliant accelerator device.
OpenCL is supported on a wide range of systems including CPU, GPU, FPGA, DSP and MIC devices.
While it is possible to write application code directly in OpenCL, it may also be used as a base to implement higher-level programming models.
This technique was shown by Mitra et al.,Â [@mitra2014implementation] where an OpenMP runtime was implemented over an OpenCL framework for Texas Instruments Keystone II DSP architecture.
Having a common back-end in the form of OpenCL allows a direct comparison of identical code across this diverse range of architectures.

OpenCL programs comprise of a host side and a device side and the program progression is always the same.
The Host is responsible for querying the suitable platforms, vendor OpenCL runtime drivers, and establishing a context on the selected devices.
Next, the host sets up memory buffers, compiles a kernel program for each device -- the final compiled device binaries are generated for each specific device instruction set architecture (ISA).

On the device-side, the developer code is en-queued for execution.
Device-side code is typically small intensive sub-regions of programs and is known as the kernel.
Kernel code is written in a subset of the C programming language.
Special functions exist to determine a threads id, this can occur via getting a global index in a given dimension directly, with `get_group_id`, or determined using `get_group_id`, `get_local_size` and `get_local_id` in each dimension.

The host side is then notified once the device has completed execution -- this takes the form of either the host waiting on the `clFinish` command or if the host does not the computed results yet, say for an intermediate result on which a second kernel will operate on the same data, a `clFlush` function call.
Once all device execution has completed and the host has been notified the results are transferred back to the host from the device.
Finally, the context established on the device is freed.

The selection of parameters on the host side can have a large impact on performance.
One primary reason is that different accelerators benefit from different levels of parallelism -- or how many threads are executed concurrently -- for instance, GPU devices usually need a high degree of arithmetic intensive parallelism to offset the (relatively) narrow I/O pipeline, CPUs on the other hand are more general purpose and the switching of threads has a greater penalty on performance.
The tuning of such parameters can positively impact performance, in the OpenCL setting by primarily influencing the workgroup size.
In essence, the global work items can be viewed from the data-parallelism perspective.
Global work indicates the number of threads or instances of a kernel to execute in total.
Additionally, these work items can be run in teams -- denoted local work groups.
Each local work group has a given size, and as previously mentioned can be determined on the device side, in the kernel code, with `get_local_id`.
Incorrectly setting the number of local work groups and therefore also the size of each work group can impact on performance directly.
Thankfully recent work shows these parameters can be automatically optimised for any accelerator architecture and is discussed in the Autotuning [Section @sec:chapter2-autotuning] further on in this chapter.
OpenCL codes can be written to be easily linked with auto-tuners -- such as allowing the local work group size being set from the command line or as a macro in the pre-processor, these are set during execution and during compilation respectively.

Kernel compilation flags are an additional tuning argument which affects runtime performance of accelerator specific OpenCL kernel codes.
These flags are set on the host side during the `clBuildProgram` procedure.
Pre-processor macros can also be defined on the kernel side which allows various loop level parallelism constructs to be enabled or disabled.
Mathematical intrinsic options can also be set to disable double floating point precision, and change how denormalised numbers are handled.
Other optimisations include using the strictest aliasing rules, use of the fast fused multiply and add instruction (with reduced precision), ignoring the signedness of floating point zeros and relaxed, finite or unsafe math operations.
Thankfully, these can also be corrected using autotuning for both kernel specific and device specific optimisations.



## Benchmark Suites{#sec:chapter2-benchmark-suites}


The NAS parallel benchmarks [@bailey1991parallel] follow a âpencil-and-paperâ approach, specifying the computational problems to be included in the benchmark suite but leaving implementation choices such as language, data structures and algorithms to the user.
The benchmarks include varied kernels and applications which allow a nuanced evaluation of a complete HPC system, however, the unconstrained approach does not readily support direct performance comparison between different hardware accelerators using a single set of codes.

Martineau et al. [@martineau2016performance] collected a suite of benchmarks and three mini-apps to evaluate Clang OpenMP 4.5 support for Nvidia GPUs.
Their focus was on comparison with CUDA; OpenCL was not considered.

Barnes et al. [@barnes2016evaluating] collected a representative set of applications from the current NERSC workload to guide optimization for Knights Landing in the Cori supercomputer.
As it is not always feasible to perform such a detailed performance study of the capabilities of different computational devices for particular applications, the benchmarks described in this paper may give a rough understanding of device performance and limitations.

Rodinia and the original OpenDwarfs benchmark suite focused on collecting a representative set of benchmarks for scientific applications, classified according to dwarfs, with a thorough diversity analysis to justify the addition of each benchmark to the corresponding suite.

The Scalable Heterogeneous Computing benchmark suite (SHOC)[@lopez2015examining], unlike OpenDwarfs and Rodinia, supports multiple nodes using MPI for distributed parallelism.
SHOC supports multiple programming models including OpenCL, CUDA and OpenACC, with benchmarks ranging from targeted tests of particular low-level hardware features to a handful of application kernels.

All 3 benchmark suites discussed in this Section as they feature an OpenCL implementation and 2 of the 3 have been categorised according to the Dwarf Taxonomy.

Sun et al.[@sun2016] propose Hetero-Mark, a Benchmark Suite for CPU-GPU Collaborative Computing, which has five benchmark applications each implemented in HCC -- which compiles to OpenCL, HIP -- for a CUDA and Radeon Open Compute back-end, and a CUDA version.
Meanwhile, Chai by GÃ³mez-Luna et al.[@gomez2017chai], offers 15 applications in 7 different implementations with the focus on supporting integrated architectures.

These benchmark suites focus on comparison between languages and environments; whereas our work focuses on benchmarking for device specific performance limitations, for example, by examining the problem sizes where these limitations occur -- this is largely ignored by benchmarking suites with fixed problem sizes.
For these reasons, we introduce the enhanced OpenDwarfs benchmark suite in [Chapter @sec:chapter-3-ode] which covers a wider range of application patterns by focusing exclusively on OpenCL using higher-level benchmarks.


### Rodinia


Che et. al [@che2009rodinia] initially proposed a benchmark suite which cover a wide range of parallel communication patterns.
The selection of these patterns was inspired by the Berkeley dwarf taxonomy, as discussed in [Section @sec:the-dwarf-taxonomy], and the selection of these benchmarks are from real world high performance scientific computing applications.
Evaluated in the paper were a NVIDIA GTX 280 GPU and an Intel Core 2 Extreme CPU.
The diversity between selected benchmarks was shown by measuring execution times, communications overheads and energy usage of running each benchmark on the target architectures.
Across the suite: speedups in execution times ranged from 5.5x to 80.8x, communication overheads vary from 2-76% and GPU power consumption overheads range from 38-83 Watts.
From this, the resulting benchmarks were proven to be useful when illustrating important architectural differences between the CPU and GPU.
However, all devices presented featured applications typical of select dwarfs which benefit from GPU architectures.
At the time this paper was written the Rodinia Benchmark suite consisted of nine applications; namely, Leukocyte Tracking, Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion, HotSpot, Back Propagation, Needleman-Wunsch, K-means, Stream Cluster, Breadth-First Search and Similarity Score, but it has since been extended.
This extension features a subset of the dwarfs, namely, Structured Grid, Unstructured Grid, Dynamic Programming, Dense Linear Algebra, MapReduce, and Graph Traversal.
Diversity analysis was also performed and took the form of a Micro-Architecture independent analysis study.
The MICA framework, discussed in [Section @sec:microarchitecture-independent], was used as the basis of the evaluation and the motivation was to justify each applications inclusion in the benchmark suite by showing deviations between applications in the corresponding kiviat diagrams.
Separate implementations were developed for each application CUDA for the GPU, and OpenMP for the CPU, OpenCL was also included for both architecture types.
Ultimately several applications from the Rodinia benchmark suite were added to the extended OpenDwarfs benchmark suite -- developed in this thesis.
However, ultimately, having several implementations caused fragmentation in development, where changes often resulted in the OpenCL version of each benchmark application being neglected; in some instances lacking an implementation of a given application entirely -- or at the least, missing features offered in other implementations.
For this reason, OpenDwarfs was selected as the benchmark suite on which to perform the extension work.

### SHOC

The Scalable Heterogeneous Computing benchmark suite SHOC, presented by Danalis et. al. [@danalis2010scalable], offer an alternative benchmark suite and unlike OpenDwarfs and Rodinia, supports multiple nodes using MPI for distributed parallelism.
It also has not been structured into the dwarf taxonomy but rather the benchmarks it encompasses have been categorised according according to two major sets, whether the application performs a stress test role or acts as a performance test.
SHOC supports multiple programming models including OpenCL, CUDA and OpenACC, with benchmarks ranging from targeted tests of particular low-level hardware features to a handful of application kernels.
The variety of language implementations for each benchmark application, was one of the original motivators for its construction.
In this benchmark suite the OpenCL versions of each application have been designed to strongly mirror the CUDA counterparts, unfortunately this results in fixed tuning parameters such as local workgroup size that is well suited to GPU architectures but is not suited to CPU and other accelerator devices.

However, since this suite has not been classified according to the dwarf taxonomy and also if the classification were performed during this these, adding more applications would likely need to occur to fully encompass the dwarf taxonomy; the addition of applications is more expensive in SHOC, since it would require implementations for the same application into at least 3 other languages -- which is not a motivating factor for this thesis.
By focusing on application kernels written exclusively in OpenCL, our enhanced OpenDwarfs bench-mark suite is able to cover a wider range of application patterns.


### OpenDwarfs

As with Rodinia, Feng et. al [@feng2012opencl] introduce the OpenDwarfs (OpenCL and the 13 Dwarfs) as an OpenCL implementation of Berkeleyâs 13 computational dwarfs of scientific computing.
In this work, the absolute execution times were collected over 11 benchmarks.
In this paper 11 applications were evaluated on 1 CPU, an Intel Xeon E5405, and 3 GPUs, a low power AMD HD5450 with 25W TDP, and 2 high-power GPUs AMD HD5870 and an Nvidia GT520, for scale both high-end GPUs had an energy footprint of 228-238W TDP respectively.
A larger range of dwarfs are covered by OpenDwarfs than Rodinia; however, one dwarf, MapReduce, is still not represented by any application.
Additionally, several dwarfs currently have one representative application which may not expose the entire set of characteristics of that dwarf.

A potential criticism is that no diversity analysis was performed to justify the inclusion of each application -- however since many applications where inherited from the Rodinia code-base these applications have a proven MICA diversity.
Recently, this work was updated and evaluated on FPGA devices by Krommydas et. al. [@krommydas2016opendwarfs] -- and adds relevancy to the OpenDwarfs benchmark suite.
Given the focused effort of having all the dwarfs represented, the choice to have one implementation -- and that being OpenCL, and the recent use of the benchmark suite for a new accelerator architecture all result in it being the selected benchmark suite to perform the extension.
These efforts are discussed in Chapter 3.



## Autotuning{#sec:chapter2-autotuning}

When combined with autotuning, an OpenCL code may exhibit good performance across varied devices.
Every application presented in the Rodinia Benchmark Suite \[sec:rodinia\] requires a local workgroup to be passed.
In the OpenDwarfs set of benchmarks 9 out of 14 allow for local workgroup tuning.
Therefore, given a majority of OpenCL programs use local workgroup tuning, serious considerations need be given regarding how to ensure an accurate depiction of execution times for all accelerators is given.
Older literature on the subject also suggests autotuning will play an increasingly important role, in determining accelerator centric optimisations.
Tasks such as compiler optimisations and kernel runtime tuning parameters are well suited to auto-tuners without requiring an exhaustive search in this search space.

This has been manifested in many auto-tuning libraries that use machine learning.
Spafford et al. [@spafford2010maestro], Chaimov et al. [@chaimov2014toward] and Nugteren and Codreanu [@nugteren2015cltune] all propose open source libraries capable of performing autotuning of dynamic execution parameters in OpenCL kernels.
Additionally, Price and McIntosh-Smith [@price2017analyzing] have demonstrated high performance using a general purpose autotuning library [@ansel:pact:2014], for three applications across twelve devices.

One auto-tuning library of particular interest is OpenTuner [@ansel:pact:2014] since it has already been employed by Price and McIntosh-Smith [@price2017analyzing] to improve the performance of OpenCL applications.
The OpenTuner library requires the search space to be defined in order to effect the runtime performance of the application.
These take the forms of command line of compile time arguments -- and are known as the configuration parameter when performing application execution.
Next, machine learning techniques are used employing a black box mechanism to effectively search for the optimal configuration parameter arguments in the search space.
Measurements are collected per run effectively updating a cost function.
Both the objective of the search and the cost function are entirely flexible, since this framework takes the form of a modular python library.

In the Price [@price2017analyzing] survey, OpenCL kernels are optimised across 9 current GPUs, 5 Nvidia and 4 AMD devices, and 3 high-end Intel CPUs.
The experiment was performed over 3 benchmarks, the Jacobi Iterative Method, a Bilateral Filtering algorithm and BUDE -- A general purpose molecular docking program.
Presented results show the inefficiencies when auto-tuning for one target device and then execute this optimised program on the other systems.
The usefulness of this multi-objective auto-tuning technique is demonstrated and shows that it is a useful tool to generate performance portable OpenCL kernels.
Additionally the literature shows that over-optimisation hurts performance portability.



## Offline Ahead-of-Time Analysis

The term offline analysis, in this setting, is defined as the detailed examination of the structure of code and that it requires the entire data set is given in advance.
Ahead-of-time indicates that this analysis be done before the program is executed.
The combination of theses two terms is directly applicable to OpenCL SPIR codes, which is based on LLVM, since LLVM is well suited to performing ahead-of-time optimised native code generation [@lattner2004llvm].
Additionally, since SPIR is hardware agnostic/ISA-independent the patterns of computation and communication as shown in the dwarf taxonomy it can be done once the OpenCL source is converted to SPIR and the dwarf represented by the kernel will always be the same.
Therefore, analysis such as the classification of which dwarf a new code can be identified, can be performed before any actual device execution is performed.
Additionally, these classification and other analysis metrics can be embedded into the SPIR code as a comment in the header, which in turn can be used by a scheduler to determine which device the kernel should be executed.

Closely related to the work performed in this thesis was independently performed by Muralidharan et. al. [@muralidharan2015semi].
Wherein, they use offline ahead-of-time analysis with Oclgrind to collect an instruction histogram of each OpenCL kernel execution in order to generate an estimate of the roofline model analysis for each given accelerator.
The resultant tool-flow methodology is used to analyse and track the performance over 3 distinct heterogeneous platforms, and results in a metric to characterise performance.


## Phase-Shifting

Phase is defined as a set of intervals (or slices in time) within a programs execution that has similar behaviour.
Therefore, the term phase-shifting refers to change of the execution of a program with temporal adjacency such that the program experiences time-varying effects.
Sherwood  et. al. [@sherwood2003discovering] observe that common system design and optimisation focus heavily on the assume average system behaviour.
They propose however instead programs should be modelled and optimised for phase-based program behaviour.
The approach outlined states that phase-behaviour can be profiled quickly using block vector [@sherwood2002automatically] profiles (a vector of per element counts, where each element is the number of times a code block has been entered over a given interval) and off-line classification.

An assumption in the literature is that OpenCL kernels are largely unaffected by program phase-shift.
Rather, the program as a whole will doubtlessly experience phase-shifts, compiling an OpenCL kernel code which is an active component of all OpenCL programs will heavily utilise the host CPU device, and when a kernel is executed and the host waits for the device to finish, CPU utilisation is low.
However, the kernel in execution itself will experience very little differences in phases since by their very nature OpenCL kernels are designed small and compartmentalised sections of computation.
Such that, if a kernel executed on a particular accelerator device is memory bound, it will consistently be memory bound.
If the accelerator experiences consistent stalls on repeated branch mispredictions, this is consistent throughout the kernels entire execution.

## Scaling

This sections discusses scaling with respect to clock frequency and core count respectively.
Included in this summary of the relevant literature is the impact it has on energy consumption -- namely the non-linear relationship between time and energy.

### Frequency

Changing the clock frequency of a conventional CPU core ultimately change performance results -- not solely just on execution times.

Choi, Soma and Pedram [@choi2005fine] present an intra-process dynamic voltage and frequency scaling with the goal of minimising energy consumption yet maximising performance by dynamically changing the clock frequency of the CPU.
This is achieved by modelling the on-chip / off-chip ratio which is updated using runtime event monitoring.
Hardware measurements showed that dynamically lowing the clock frequency for memory bound problems up to 70% energy was saved with a 12% performance loss, compute bound workloads 15-60% energy savings were had at a cost of losing 5-20% performance.

Meanwhile, Agarwal et. al. [@Agarwal:2000:CRV:339647.339691] show that wire latencies (which correspond to memory movement and chip-to-chip communication) have not matched the increase in the range of clock-frequency.
As such the impact of increasing the clock frequency is having (and will continue to have) less of an impact on computational efficiency.

Recently, Brown [@brown2010toward] discusses how increasing the clock frequency to generate a result faster (known as race-to-idle or race-to-sleep) saves up to 95% of energy if the entire system can be put in a suspended state -- as in embedded and mobile systems.
In 2014, this was validated for hardware used in HPC provided it supports a sleep state.
Albers and Antoniadis [@Albers:2014:RIN:2578852.2556953] present a framework to accurately approximate the energy cost of speed scaling with a sleep state.
In this study, the authors show that the active state of a CPU is comparable to the dynamic energy needed for processing.

### Core count

Taylor [@taylor2012dark] surveys the transition of typical homogeneous cores to a potentially dark silicone -- bright future for heterogeneous systems.
This is not because of the lack of scale from increasing cores, indeed Taylor proposes this trend will continue, but from energy concerns of having the utilisation wall[@venkatesh2010conservation].


### Time and Energy -- a non-linear relationship

Additionally, there exist applications where the coupling between execution time and energy consumption is non-linear[lively2011energy], and as such, there should be dwarfs wherein this non-linear relationship holds.

##Program Diversity Analysis and characterization {#sec:chapter2-program-diversity-analysis}

Program Diversity Analysis has occurred historically to justify the inclusion of an application into a benchmark suite for many years, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used to demonstrate program diversity by others[@blackburn2006dacapo][@hara2009proposal][@phansalkar2007analysis].
Often this work, is manually performed by those focused on assembling the benchmark suites.
Indeed, much of the motivation for curating OpenCL applications in Rodinia [@che2009rodinia], OpenDwarfs [@feng2012opencl] and SHOC [@danalis2010scalable] was to have real-world scientific problems that represented regular workloads of HPC and SC systems.
Determining the suitability of an application regarding these characterised metrics has been evaluated by others.
This Section examines these combined efforts in characterising workloads that are less sensitive to the architectures on which they are executed, and concludes with how these characterisation techniques have been used when assembling benchmark suites.

The use of a vector-space or feature-space in order to classify the characteristics of parallel programs was performed by Meajil, El-Ghazawi and Sterling in 1997 [@meajil1997architecture].
The target of this work was to determine the major factors in modelling performance between parallel computer architectures in an architecture-independent manner.
The remainder of this section introduces more recent developments in using a vector-space to characterise applications.

##Microarchitecture-independent workload characterization {#sec:microarchitecture-independent}

Hoste and Eeckhout [@hoste2007microarchitecture] propose metrics to characterise an application independent to the corresponding microarchitectural characteristics.
In this work, Hoste and Eeckout show that despite being useful when locating performance bottlenecks [@ganesan2008performance] [@prakash2008performance], the conventional microarchitecture-dependent characteristics are misleading when used as a basis on which to differentiate benchmark applications.
The dependent characteristics typically include instructions per cycle (IPC) and miss rates -- cache, branch misprediction and translation look-aside buffer (TLB) -- and are collected from hardware performance counter results, typically PAPI.
However, the results generated from them is misleading as they either indicate two benchmark applications are similar if they have similar hardware performance counter results or different, since they have different counter results, and this analysis potentially hides the underlying, inherent program behaviour.
Additionally, microarchitecture-dependent characteristics are increasingly limited as they are heavily variable between systems, results are machine dependent since CPU architectures significantly differ in pipeline depth and cache size.

Instead Hoste propose a higher level metric framework based on results which do not vary between microarchitecture -- the Microarchitecture-independent workload characterization.
Features in this metric include instruction mix, Instruction-level parallelism (ILP), Register traffic, Working-set size, Data stream strides and Branch predictability.
These feature results were collected using the PIN [@luk2005pin] binary instrumentation tool.
In total 48 measurement characteristics are presented in order to classify an application in a microarchitecture agnostic manner.
To reduce the variety of measurements presented, the authors use Principal Component Analysis to reduce the number of measurements in this feature-space to 8 dimensions -- those with the largest variance and corresponding impact between applications.

This research is also released as the MICA software and is deployed as a PIN module.

A caveat in the MICA approach is that the results presented are not instruction set architecture independent nor independent from differences in compilers.

###ISA-independent workload characterization{#sec:chapter2-isa-independent}

More recently, Shao and Brooks [@shao2013isa] have extended the generality of workload characterisation to be ISA independent.
The primary motivation for this work was in evaluating the suitability of benchmark suites when targeted on general purpose accelerator platforms.
This work was inspired by the MICA framework and collects similar features to those presented in the Hoste and Eeckhout [@hoste2007microarchitecture] paper.

Instead of using PIN events on x86 systems, this technique uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to trace instrumented features over a compiler intermediate representation (IR) -- in this instance the Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) representation.
The proposed framework briefly evaluates eleven SPEC benchmarks and examines 5 ISA-independent features/metrics.
Namely, number of opcodes (e.g., add, mul), the value of branch entropy -- a measure of the randomness of branch behavior, the value of memory entropy -- a metric based on the lack of memory locality when examining accesses, the unique number of static instructions, and the unique number of data addresses.

The branch entropy measure presented in the Shao and Brooks paper was initially proposed by Yokota [@yokota2007introducing] and uses Shannon's information entropy to determine a score of Branch History Entropy.

An additional metric, the average linear branch entropy metric , was recently suggested by De Pestel [@DePestel:2017:LBE:3057890.3057908].
It is unique, in that the floating-point value presented linearly corresponds to the miss-rate flow of program execution; $p=0$ for branches always taken or not-taken but $p=0.5$ for the most unpredictable control flow.
Thus, it offers a bounded value of $0-0.5$ and it additionally offers an averaging method that is also easily presented.

###Using workload characterization for diversity analysis in the benchmark suites

Several benchmarks have performed characterisation of applications in the past, this has been primarily, at least historically motivated, for diversity analysis to justify the inclusion of an application into a benchmark suite.
Rodinia used MICA as the diversity analysis framework.
However, the OpenDwarfs benchmark suite have applications which have been manually classified as dwarfs and any characterisation into this taxonomy is based largely intuition.
Some of the shared applications ported from the Rodinia Benchmark suite cluster microarchitecture-dependent characteristics of applications into dwarfs.
Alas, the approach has the same limitations as those presented in [Section @sec:microarchitecture-independent].

\todo[inline]{we will do the verification?}

For this reason Chapter 4 of this thesis apart from extending the OpenDwarfs Benchmark suite also adds formal verification of the diversity characterisation.
To some extent Chapter 5 does this even more formally by generating and clustering the feature-space of all applications grouped as dwarfs.
The evaluation on the feature-space is critical to the inclusion of particular extended OpenDwarfs applications and is performed in Chapter 4.

##Oclgrind: Debugging OpenCL kernels via simulation{#sec:oclgrind}

Oclgrind is an OpenCL device simulator developed by Price and McIntosh-Smith [@price:15] capable of performing simulated kernel execution.
It operates on a restricted LLVM IR known as Standard Portable Intermediate Representation (SPIR) established by the Khronos group consortium [@kessenich2015], thereby simulating OpenCL kernel code in a hardware agnostic manner.
This architecture independence allows the tool to uncover many portability issues when migrating OpenCL code between devices.
Additionally Oclgrind comes with a set of tools to detect runtime API errors, race conditions and locating invalid memory accesses but also comes with an ability to generate instruction histograms.
These histograms show the computational composition of a kernel as a series of SPIR instructions with the corresponding count, these results can be used to directly infer the instruction mix similarly to the mechanisms presented in [Section @sec:chapter2-isa-independent].


##Schedulers and Predicting the most Appropriate Accelerator

Lyerly [@lyerly2014automatic] demonstrates by executing a subset of applications from OpenDwarfs it becomes apparent that not one accelerator has the fastest execution time for all benchmarks.
This contribution focuses on developing a scheduler to delegate the most appropriate accelerator for a given program.
This was achieved by developing a partitioning tool to separate computationally intensive OpenMP regions from C, extracting to and building a predictive model based on past history of the programs executing on the accelerators.
We broaden this analysis by claiming that all benchmarks encompassing a dwarf will perform optimally on one accelerator type, but identify that one type of accelerator is non-optimal for all dwarfs.

Hoste et. al. [@hoste2006performance] show that the prediction of performance can be based on inherent program similarity.
In particular, they show that the metrics collected from a program executing on a particular instruction set architecture (ISA) with a specific compiler offers a relatively accurate characterization of workload for the same application on a totally different micro-architecture.
[Che et. al. @che2009rodinia] broadens this finding with an assumption that performing analysis on a single threaded CPU version of a benchmark application maintains the underlying set of instructions and the composition of the application.

Therefore, it is intuitive that the composition of a program collected using a simulator (such as Oclgrind discussed in [Section @sec:oclgrind], which operates on the most common intermediate form for the OpenCL runtime) regardless of accelerator to which it is ultimately mapped, offers a more accurate architecture agnostic set of metrics around an applications workload.
This, in turn, can be used as a basis for performance prediction on general accelerators.

##Formal measurements{#sec:formal-measurements}

Many studies presented in this thesis use tools developed by others in order to perform the necessary measurements.
Time measurements have primarily used LibSciBench as the default performance measurement tool.
It allows high precision timing events to be collected for statistical analysis [@hoefler2015scientific].
Additionally, it offers a high resolution timer in order to measure short running kernel codes, reported with one cycle resolution and roughly 6 ns of overhead.
Throughout Chapter 4 LibSciBench was intensively used to record timings in conjunction with hardware events, which it collects via PAPI [@mucci1999papi] counters.
