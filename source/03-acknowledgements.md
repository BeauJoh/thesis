# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

Thank you to my supervisors Josh, Greg and Alistair.
Josh, you've been an excellent friend and mentor and I wouldn't have a thesis if you weren't so supportive or engaged in this work -- it has actually been a lot of fun working so closely and bouncing ideas off each other.
Greg, you've always supported me, technically and emotionally and I feel privileged that we've been able to collaborate so closely despite being 750 kilometers apart.
Alistair, thank you for bringing me to the ANU and being so patient with this perpetual student, you have shaped me -- for better or worse -- into thinking like a cynical scientist.
You've taught me the basics and still somehow found the time -- and funding -- for me.
You've certainly had your plate full supervising me, it must have felt like a 4th helping, and now you must be sick to the bursting point of me -- and rightly so -- that's why you've moved to Adelaide.
You have all had to repeat yourselves far too frequently yet somehow maintained the vigour to keep me on track whilst still temper my wild ideas -- and then finally pushed me through the writing up process.
I wouldn't have considered spending my life as a researcher or scientist if my role-models had been any less kind or brilliant. Thank you so much!

Thank you to my loving family -- Sue, Paul, Eddie, Betty and Ron -- I've been incredibly lucky to come from such a supportive environment, there is no way I would have had the confidence to even enrol in university much less stick through a PhD program.

My long-time suffering partner Flo... sorry!
You have been on the front-lines of work complaints, frustrations and my sheer single mindedness to get this bloody thing finished for far too long.
I can't imagine how you still have the determination to start your own PhD shortly -- I'm very proud of you.
Also, sorry about coming home at 5am with no teeth -- and the PhDesq Stockholm syndrome that caused it.

To The Hermits, Alice, Clancy and Cody -- I couldn't imagine living in better place for the write-up.
The garden's ample, the food first-rate, and the company exceptional.

I would also like to thank all my office buddies over the years -- Brian, Edwin, Jess, Shayanti, Gaurav, Anish, Luke, Kunshan and Guyver -- without the support and communal suffering you all provided I would have abandoned my PhD a long time ago.
At various stages, you have all fed me, helped me de-stress by running me round a badminton court, listened to my ample complaints and discuss my -- from your perspectives what must be especially boring -- ideas.

You have all been amazingly supportive friends and family and I love you all very much.

Thank you to my colleagues at The University of Bristol's High Performance Computing Research group for the use of ``The Zoo`` Research cluster which was used for the experimental evaluation, it was critical to generating the runtime results.

Finally, I would also like to thank Oracle and the ANU VC Travel Grants Office for providing additional funding, this was invaluable for conference attendance.
