<!-- Thank you to my supervisors Josh, Greg and Alistair.
Thank you to my supervisors Josh, Alistair and Greg.
I couldnt not have asked for more patient, understanding yet still technically excellent roll models.
You have all had to repeat yourselves far too much and having the rigour to keep me on track and actively encourage my wild ideas -- albeit interspersed with dull writing.

Thank you to my family, mum, dad, brother, nan and pop -- Sue, Paul, Eddie, Betty and Ron -- I've been incredibly lucky to come from such a supportive environment, there is no way I would have had the confidence to even enrol in university much less stick through a PhD program.

My long-time suffering partner Flo... sorry!
You have been on the front-lines of PhD complaints, frustrations and my single mindedness to get this bloody thing finished for far too long.
I can't imagine how you still have the determination to start your own shortly -- I'm very proud of you.
Also, sorry about coming home at 5am with no teeth -- and the Stockholm syndrome that caused it.

I would also like to thank all my office buddies over the years -- Brian, Edwin, Jess, Shayanti, Gaurav, Anish, Luke and Kunshan -- without the support and communal suffering you all provided I would have abandoned my PhD a long time ago.
At various stages, you have all fed me, helped me de-stress by running me round a badminton court, listened to me complain more than my fair share and discuss -- from your perspectives must be especially boring -- ideas.

You have all been amazingly supportive friends and family and I love you all very much.

Thank you to our colleagues at The University of Bristol's High Performance Computing Research group for the use of ``The Zoo`` Research cluster for experimental evaluation which was critical to generating the runtime results.

Finally, I would also like to thank Oracle and the ANU VC Travel Grants Office for providing additional funding, this was invaluable for conference attendance.
