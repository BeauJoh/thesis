<!-- This is for acknowledging all of the people who helped out -->

Thank you to our colleagues at The University of Bristol's High Performance Computing Research group for the use of ``The Zoo`` Research cluster for experimental evaluation which was critical to generating the runtime results.

I would also like to thank Oracle and the ANU VC Travel Grants Office for providing additional funding, this was invaluable for conference attendance.
