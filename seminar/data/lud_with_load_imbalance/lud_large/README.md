Note: due to camera-ready submission deadlines the LUD large data for the kiviat data need to be rerun -- however this is the largest applications and requires the many iterations and days to complete.
As such, the last full results from ../feat_data/lud_large were used and supplemented with the "min instructions executed by a work-item", "max instructions executed by a work-item" and "median instructions executed by a work-item" which don't change for this application in any of the 3 kernels between invocation / iteration.
